- **Social Engineering:** The Digispark Attiny85 can be used as part of a social engineering attack, such as leaving a USB device with malware in a public area to entice someone to insert it into their computer.

#### How HID Attacks works here

HID attacks, also known as "USB rubber ducky" attacks, use a device that emulates a human interface device (HID), such as a keyboard or mouse, to send a series of keystrokes to a target computer. The Digispark Attiny85 can be programmed to perform HID attacks by emulating a keyboard or mouse and sending pre-defined keystrokes or mouse movements to the target computer. Here is a example of how a HID attack could work using the Digispark Attiny85:

- An attacker creates a payload script that contains a series of keystrokes or mouse movements that will be executed on the target computer.

- The attacker loads the payload script onto the Digispark Attiny85 and connects it to the target computer using a USB cable.

- When the Digispark Attiny85 is plugged into the target computer, it appears as a keyboard or mouse to the operating system.

- The Digispark Attiny85 then executes the payload script by sending a series of keystrokes or mouse movements to the target computer.

- Depending on the payload script, the attack could do things like open a backdoor, install malware, steal data, or execute other malicious actions.

#### How Rubber Ducky Attacks works here

Rubber Ducky Attacks are a specific type of HID attack that use a device that emulates a keyboard and executes predefined keystrokes to exploit vulnerabilities on a target machine. The Digispark Attiny85 can be used as a Rubber Ducky device by programming it to act as a keyboard and send pre-defined keystrokes to a target computer. Rubber Ducky Attacks can be an effective way to bypass security controls and exploit vulnerabilities on a target machine.

#### How Wireless Attacks works here

The Digispark Attiny85 can be used for wireless attacks when combined with additional hardware components, such as a wireless module or antenna. Here's a brief overview of how wireless attacks with Digispark Attiny85 can work:

- The Digispark Attiny85 is placed in a location where it can intercept or manipulate wireless traffic, such as near a wireless access point or target device.

- The payload code executes and begins to intercept or manipulate wireless traffic as programmed.

- Depending on the payload code and the type of wireless attack being conducted, the attacker may be able to eavesdrop on wireless communications, steal sensitive information, or gain unauthorized access to a wireless network.

#### How Physical Security Testing works here
The Digispark Attiny85 can be used for physical security testing by simulating physical actions that can compromise the security of a target system. Here's an overview of how physical security testing with the Digispark Attiny85 can work:

- The attacker loads a payload onto the Digispark Attiny85 that contains code for simulating physical actions, such as opening a locked door or disabling an alarm system.

- The Digispark Attiny85 is connected to the target system using a physical interface, such as a USB port.

- The payload code executes and simulates the physical action as programmed.

- Depending on the payload code and the type of physical action being simulated, the attacker may be able to bypass physical security controls, gain unauthorized access to a system, or steal sensitive information.

Examples of physical security testing scenarios that could be simulated with the Digispark Attiny85 include unlocking a locked computer, disabling an alarm system, or bypassing a physical access control system.

#### How Social Engineering works here

The Digispark Attiny85 can be used as a tool in social engineering attacks, where the attacker manipulates individuals to disclose sensitive information or perform actions that can compromise security. Here's an overview of how social engineering attacks with the Digispark Attiny85 can work:

- The attacker loads a payload onto the Digispark Attiny85 that contains code for social engineering tactics, such as phishing or pretexting.

- The Digispark Attiny85 is used to create a pretext, such as posing as an IT administrator, to deceive the victim into disclosing sensitive information or performing an action that compromises security.

- Depending on the payload code and the social engineering tactics being used, the attacker may be able to steal passwords or other sensitive information, gain unauthorized access to a system, or install malware.

Examples of social engineering attacks that could be conducted with the Digispark Attiny85 include posing as an IT administrator to obtain login credentials, sending a phishing email with a malicious attachment, or using pretexting to obtain sensitive information from a victim.
